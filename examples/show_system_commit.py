"""
Tested on: SR OS 24.3.R1

Show the commit history in an alternate format.

Execution on SR OS
    usage: pyexec bin/show_system_commit.py
Execution on remote machine
    usage: python show_system_commit.py username@host
Execution on remote machine if show_system_commit.py is executable
    usage: ./show_system_commit.py username@host

Add the following alias so that the Python application can be run as
a native MD-CLI command.  The alias is named "commit-history" because
"commit" is an MD-CLI command that cannot be aliased.  You can still type
"show system commit" using command completion though.
