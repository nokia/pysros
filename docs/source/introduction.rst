Introduction
############

The pySROS libraries provide a model-driven management interface for
Python developers to integrate with supported Nokia routers
running the Service Router Operating System (SR OS).

The libraries provide an Application Programming Interface (API) for developers
to create applications that can interact with Nokia SR OS devices, whether those
applications are executed from a development machine, a remote server, or directly on the router.

When a developer uses only libraries and constructs supported on SR OS, a
single application may be executed from a development machine or ported
directly to an SR OS node where the application is executed without modification.

Pre-requisites
##############

To use the pySROS libraries, the following pre-requisites must be met:

- one or more SR OS nodes

  - Running in model-driven management interface configuration mode
  - Running SR OS 21.7.R1 or greater (to execute applications on the SR OS device)
  - With NETCONF enabled and accessible by an authorized user (to execute applications
    remotely)

- a Python 3 interpreter of version 3.10 or newer when using the pySROS libraries to
  execute applications remotely

All the required software is included and installed automatically on the SR OS node, including
the Python 3 interpreter and all supported Python libraries.

The pySROS libraries have been tested to work with other Network Operating Systems (NOS) using
standards-based NETCONF implementations, specifically, SR Linux.  When using alternative Network
Operating Systems, the use of the :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.lock` and 
:py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.unlock` methods is strongly encouraged.

YANG modeling
#############

It is assumed that the developer has a working knowledge of model-driven
management in a networking environment and of YANG models and their constituent
parts.

The `Nokia YANG models are available for each release of SR OS on GitHub <https://github.com/nokia/7x50_YangModels>`_.

.. _modeled-paths:

Modeled paths
**************

At the root of the pySROS libraries is Nokia's model-driven management concepts
built into SR OS.

Communication between applications developed using the pySROS libraries and
Nokia SR OS routers is achieved using model-driven paths referencing elements
within the Service Router Operating System.

The pySROS libraries accept modeled paths in the JSON instance path format,
a path format based on
`RFC 6020 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6020#section-9.13>`_ and
`RFC 7951 <https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7951#section-6.11>`_.
This path format describes the YANG models to which it is referencing, including
all YANG lists, YANG list keys, and their key values (although in some instances,
these may be omitted).

The JSON instance path can be obtained directly from an SR OS router running
software from release 21.7.R1 by entering ``pwc json-instance-path``
in the MD-CLI in the context to be referenced.

See the following for examples:

- :ref:`pwc-json-instance-path-sros-services-config-example`
- :ref:`pwc-json-instance-path-sros-bgp-state-example`
- :ref:`pwc-json-instance-path-sros-openconfig-example`

Once a connection to the pySROS interface on the node has been established (see :ref:`making-a-connection`) the 
:py:meth:`.Connection.list_paths` method can used to obtain a list of the supported YANG-modeled paths for that specific
router in the JSON instance path format.

Schema aware
************

The pySROS libraries are YANG schema aware.  Each element has knowledge
of its path, model, and data type in the YANG model.

The YANG schema is automatically obtained by the pySROS libraries by performing one
of the following upon connection (using :py:meth:`pysros.management.connect`).

   * Download the YANG models from the targeted nodes using
     `YANG library as described in RFC 8525 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8525>`_ and `get-schema as defined
     in RFC 6022 <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6022>`_ (default).  For this to work the YANG models must
     be available from the SR OS device and the schema-path set correctly (for more information, see the
     SR OS System Management Guide).
   * Compile a YANG model or set of YANG models located on a file system and referenced by the developer.

.. note ::

   When executing a Python application using the pySROS libraries on a remote workstation, the initial
   connection to a node is slower than subsequent connections as the schema is generated
   from the YANG models and cached.

Network communication
#####################

When executing applications remotely, the pySROS
libraries use NETCONF for communication between the remote node and the SR OS node.  To facilitate this, the SR OS node must be
configured to allow NETCONF access from the location that the application is run.

For more information about configuring SR OS to use NETCONF, see the SR OS System
Management Guide.

         string, allowing the developer to cast the element into a specified type.

.. _yang_identityrefs:

YANG identity references
************************
Identity references are a YANG construct that provide a way to reference a previously
defined ``identity``.  This ``identity`` may be located in the same, or more commonly, another YANG
module.

Unlike other elements in YANG, the namespace for an identityref is
stored as part of the value of a node, rather than the node itself:

.. code-block:: xml
   :caption: Example identityref in XML
   :name: identityref-xml-example
   :emphasize-lines: 6-8

   <interfaces xmlns="http://openconfig.net/yang/interfaces">
       <interface>
           <name>1/1/c1/1</name>
           <config>
               <name>1/1/c1/1</name>
               <type xmlns:iana-if-type="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:iana-if-type">
                   iana-if-type:ethernetCsmacd
               </type>
           </config>
       </interface>
   </interfaces>

In pySROS the namespace portion of an ``identityref`` value must be the YANG *module name*
of the module where the referenced ``identity`` resides:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Example identityref in pySROS
   :name: identityref-pysros-example
   :emphasize-lines: 2,5

   >>> path = '/openconfig-interfaces:interfaces/interface[name="1/1/c1/1"]/config'
   >>> payload = {'name': '1/1/c1/1', 'type': 'iana-if-type:ethernetCsmacd'}
   >>> connection_object.candidate.set(path, payload)
   >>> connection_object.running.get(path+'/type')
   Leaf('iana-if-type:ethernetCsmacd')

If a YANG *module name* is omitted when referencing an ``identity``, pySROS attempts
to determine the *module name* from the known YANG schema for that device.  If pySROS
cannot determine the correct *module name* an :py:exc:`pysros.exceptions.SrosMgmtError` Exception is returned.

.. note::

   Nokia recommends explicitly describing the YANG module name in an ``identityref``.

Wrappers
********
To assist with data manipulation, data structures obtained from SR OS are wrapped with
class identifiers depending on their YANG element structure.  This additional information can assist
developers when writing Python code to analyze, manipulate, and output modeled data.

YANG containers are wrapped in the :py:class:`pysros.wrappers.Container` class.

YANG leaf-lists are wrapped in the :py:class:`pysros.wrappers.LeafList` class.

YANG leafs are wrapped in the :py:class:`pysros.wrappers.Leaf` class.  Use the ``data`` variable to
obtain the value of the leaf without the wrapper, as in the following example: :ref:`leaf-dot-data-example`.

Example:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Obtaining the value of an object wrapped in the :py:class:`pysros.wrappers.Leaf` class

YANG schema information
***********************
Additional information from the model-driven YANG schema is available to developers for
each element in a data structure obtained from SR OS using the pySROS libraries.  This
metadata can be queried on demand by calling the :py:class:`pysros.wrappers.Schema` class
against the element.

YANG schema information currently available includes:

   * - range

Annotations and metadata
************************

Annotations and metadata are terms often used interchangeably for additional supporting information
applied to a node in a YANG tree without being included as part of the actual value of that node and
without the need to create a new node to contain the information.

Annotations are defined in YANG and fall into two broad categories:

* **User defined annotations**

  Supporting information provided and consumed by the user of pySROS attached to a YANG
  node.  An example is a configuration comment applied to a node in an SR OS configuration
  using the MD-CLI ``annotate`` command.

* **System or protocol defined annotations**

  Defined in a specification for a specific purpose only.  These may be added, removed, or edited by a user
  but they have very specific meanings and perform very specific functions in a protocol.  An example is the ``operation`` attribute of an XML document used with NETCONF when manipulating user-ordered
  lists.

Annotations (metadata) are defined in `RFC 7952 <https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc7952>`_ and are
supported in XML and JSON (IETF) encodings.

Annotations in pySROS are similar to the :py:class:`pysros.wrappers.Schema` class but, unlike the
:py:class:`pysros.wrappers.Schema` class, the :py:class:`pysros.wrappers.Annotations` is writable.

See the :py:class:`pysros.wrappers.Annotations` class for more details.

.. _making-a-connection:

Making a connection
*******************

To connect to a device running SR OS, a :py:class:`pysros.management.Connection` object must be
created.  The :py:meth:`pysros.management.connect` method creates this object.

The pySROS libraries are designed to provide a level of portability for applications, allowing
developers to create applications within a preferred development environment and to execute them
locally or transfer them to SR OS for execution.

The :py:meth:`pysros.management.connect` method provides arguments
that allow the developer to specify parameters, such as the authentication credentials
and TCP port.  These attributes are ignored when an application is executed from an
SR OS node.

Obtaining data
**************

Use the :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.get` method to obtain model-driven data from an SR OS device.  
This method takes a single JSON instance path (see the :ref:`modeled-paths` section) and returns a data structure.

The :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.get` method can be performed against the ``running``, ``intended`` or ``candidate`` datastores
when *configuration* data is required.  When *state* data is required, it can only be performed against the
``running`` datastore.

.. note::

   When using combined configuration and state schemas, such as OpenConfig, the :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.get`
   method obtains both configuration and state information, unless the ``config_only=True`` flag is provided.

Configuring SR OS routers
*************************

Configuration of SR OS devices is achieved using an atomic :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.set` method.  This method takes
two inputs: the first is a JSON instance path (see the :ref:`modeled-paths` section) and the second is the payload in
the pySROS data structure format.

The :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.set` method can be performed against the ``candidate`` datastore only and *state*
data cannot be set.

For example, to enable the gRPC interface and gNMI on a device, the configuration elements for
these settings are located in the ``/nokia-conf:configure/system/grpc`` path.

The configuration settings in the MD-CLI are:

.. code-block:: none

   /configure system grpc admin-state enable
   /configure system grpc allow-unsecure-connection
   /configure system grpc gnmi { }
   /configure system grpc gnmi { admin-state enable }

The pySROS data structure format for this configuration is as shown:

.. code-block:: python3

   Container({'allow-unsecure-connection': Leaf(Empty),
              'admin-state': Leaf('enable'),
              'gnmi': Container({'admin-state': Leaf('enable')})})

To configure the SR OS device, use the :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.set` method as follows:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Configuration example using :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.set`
   :name: set-example

   from pysros.management import connect, Empty
   from pysros.wrappers import Leaf, Container
   connection_object = connect()
   path = '/nokia-conf:configure/system/grpc'
   payload = Container({'allow-unsecure-connection': Leaf(Empty),
                        'admin-state': Leaf('enable'),
                        'gnmi': Container({'admin-state': Leaf('enable')})})
   connection_object.candidate.set(path, payload)

The :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.set` method creates a private candidate configuration on the SR OS device,
makes the required configuration changes, validates the changes, performs an update of the baseline configuration
datastore, and commits the changes before releasing the private candidate.  The operation is atomic, that is,
all configuration changes must be made successfully or the configuration remains unchanged.

Objects obtained using :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.get` may be returned directly to
:py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.set` if no *state* information is included.

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Example using :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.set` with an object obtained from :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.get`
   :name: get-set-example

   from pysros.management import connect, Empty
   from pysros.wrappers import Leaf, Container
   connection_object = connect()
   path = '/nokia-conf:configure/system/grpc'
   payload = connection_object.running.get(path)
   connection_object.candidate.set(path, payload)


The :py:meth:`pysros.management.Datastore.set` method also accepts payloads that do not include the pySROS wrapper information.
This enables the developer to simply structure their own data.

.. code-block:: python

Performing operations
*********************

An operation refers to the execution of an activity on the SR OS node that is not that of
obtaining data or configuring the device.  The method of performing operations on the SR OS
node through the pySROS libraries is using YANG-modeled actions.

This approach allows for YANG-modeled and structured data to be used on both input and
output.  Both input and output are represented as pySROS data structures.

To execute a YANG-modeled operation, the :py:meth:`pysros.management.Connection.action`
method should be used.

The :py:meth:`pysros.management.Connection.action` method uses the YANG schema obtained as
part of the creation of the :py:class:`pysros.management.Connection` object.  As an input, the
path to the YANG ``action`` statement should be provided in *json-instance-path* format along
with the YANG ``input`` parameters in pySROS data structure format.

For example, consider the following YANG module:

.. code-block:: yang
   :caption: Example YANG action model
   :name: yang-action-example-model
   :emphasize-lines: 7-23

   module example {
       yang-version "1.1";
       namespace "urn:nokia.com:example";
       prefix "nokia-example";
       revision "2022-09-09";
       container mycontainer {
           action do-something {
               input {
                   leaf myinput-string {
                       type string;
                       mandatory true;
                   }
                   leaf myinput-int {
                       type uint8;
                       mandatory true;
                   }
               }
               output {
                   leaf working {
                       type boolean;
                   }
               }
           }
       }
   }

The *json-instance-path* to the YANG action statement in the above model is
``/example:mycontainer/do-something``.  The input to this YANG action takes two
mandatory fields; ``myinput-string`` and ``myinput-int``.

If the ``do-something`` action was called with the input variables ``myinput-string`` and
``myinput-int`` being provided as ``mystring`` and ``2`` respectively to method call would
look like this:

.. code-block:: python
   :caption: Example calling a YANG-modeled action (operation)
   :name: calling-yang-action-example

   >>> from pysros.management import connect
   >>> connection_object = connect()
   >>> path = '/example:mycontainer/do-something'
   >>> input_parameters = {'myintput-string': 'mystring', 'myinput-int': 2}
   >>> output = connection_object.action(path, input_parameters)
   >>> output
   Container({'working': Leaf(True)})
   >>> output['working'].data
   True

As can be seen in the example above, the output provided is a pySROS data structure that
can be accessed in the same way as other pySROS data structures native to Python.
