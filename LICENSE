# SOFTWARE LICENCE AGREEMENT FOR pySROS LIBRARY #


**PLEASE READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR USING 
THE SOFTWARE.  BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, OR OTHERWISE USING THE SOFTWARE, 
YOU ARE AGREEING THAT YOU HAVE READ THIS LICENSE, UNDERSTAND IT, AND AGREE 
(INDIVIDUALLY, OR, IF EMPLOYED, ON BEHALF OF THE ENTITY WHICH EMPLOYS YOU) TO BE 
BOUND BY ITS TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THE TERMS AND 
CONDITIONS OF THIS LICENSE OR, IF THE LICENSE IS TO BE USED BY OR ON BEHALF OF AN 
ENTITY AND YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED BY THE ENTITY, THEN DO NOT INSTALL OR USE THE 
SOFTWARE.**


This Software License Agreement ("LICENSE") is between Nokia of America Corporation, a 
Delaware corporation with a principal office at 600-700 Mountain Avenue, Murray Hill, New 
Jersey 07974 ("Licensor"), and you individually, if you are agreeing to it in your own capacity, or 
if you are authorized to enter into this LICENSE on behalf of your company or other 
organization, then the entity for whose benefit you act ("End User" or "you"). Licensor, End User, 
and you are sometimes referred to herein individually as a "Party" and collectively as the 
"Parties."     

This LICENSE is effective on the date that you first download, install, or use the Software 
("Effective Date").

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements and covenants herein 
contained and intending to be legally bound thereby, the Parties agree as follows:

1. SOFTWARE

    As used in this LICENSE, the "Software" is the pySROS software library found in the locations 
identified in Appendix A, and the associated materials (the "Documentation").  
   

2. LICENSE

    a. Licensor hereby grants to End User a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, 
and personal license under Licensor copyrights existing as of the Effective Date to use the 
Software and Documentation in the form furnished to End User, or as modified pursuant to 
Section 2(b), in either case solely in End User's environment and in connection with Nokia's 
SR OS product.  

    b. End User may (i) configure or customize the Software within the parameters of the 
Software's features and functionality, or (ii) fix bugs, modify or otherwise create derivative 
works of the Software, provided, however, that in the case of bug fixes, modification or other 
derivative works, (x) End User promptly provides Licensor (at the address set forth in 
Section 12(f)) with a copy of all such bug fixes, modifications or other derivative works, and 
(y) End User grants to Licensor and its affiliates, a non-exclusive, perpetual, royalty-free 
license to use such bug fixes, modifications or other derivative works for its business 
purposes.  

    c. All bug fixes, modifications and other derivative works of the Software shall only be usable to 
the extent of the license granted for the original Software.



3. OWNERSHIP AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

    a. The Software and Documentation are not sold to End User.  Instead, the End User 
receives the license under Section 2.  End User acknowledges and agrees that Licensor and its 
third party licensors own and retain full ownership rights in Software and Documentation and all 
Intellectual Property Rights therein.  "Intellectual Property Rights" means any and all rights 
under patent law, copyright law, trade secret law, trademark law, and any and all other 
proprietary rights.

   b. No rights or licenses are granted, directly or indirectly, whether by implication or under 
any theory of estoppel, under any Intellectual Property Rights of Licensor or of any third party 
except those expressly set forth in Section 2 of this Agreement or in licenses described in 
Section 5 below.   

   c. Nothing contained herein will be construed as conferring by implication, estoppel or 
otherwise any license or right under any patent, whether or not the exercise of any right herein 
granted necessarily employs an invention of any existing or later issued patent except to the 
extent necessary for End User to use the Software as prescribed in Section 2 above. 


4. FOSS

    a. The Software contains free or open source software (FOSS) that is integrated with the 
Software, and to which third party license obligations apply.   Appendix B attached hereto 
contains information (accurate to the best of Licensor's knowledge) indicating the license under 
which such FOSS was released, and containing required acknowledgements, legends and/or 
notices.  Unless otherwise dictated by a FOSS license (such as GPL, LGPL, and Affero GPL) 
that requires Licensor to grant the same rights to the parties to whom we distribute the FOSS, 
End User's rights to use, copy, and further distribute (if applicable) the FOSS are governed by 
this LICENSE.  
   
   b. If End User modifies any FOSS, then notwithstanding any other provisions to the 
contrary, (a) End User agrees to promptly provide to Licensor copies of the modified FOSS, and 
(b) Licensor will have no  liability or obligation to provide support, maintenance, warranty or 
indemnity with respect to the modified FOSS or any Licensor products with which the modified 
version of the FOSS interacts.


5. TERM 
   
    a. Unless terminated by Licensor as provided in this LICENSE, the license granted herein 
becomes effective on the Effective Date.  
   
   b. This LICENSE will terminate automatically and without provision of notice by Licensor if 
End User fails to comply with any of the terms or conditions of this LICENSE.
   
   c. Upon expiration or termination of the LICENSE for any reason, End User agrees that 
End User will cease all use of the Software and Documentation and all Confidential Information 
and promptly return all of the Software, Documentation and all Confidential Information and 
copies thereof to Licensor or destroy all Software, Documentation and all Confidential 
Information and all copies thereof and certify to Licensor such destruction in writing within thirty 
(30) days of such termination or expiration.


6. NO WARRANTY/MAINTENANCE 
   
    a. Licensor shall not be held to any liability for errors or omissions in the Software.
   
    b. Neither the execution of this LICENSE nor anything in this LICENSE or in the Software, 
Documentation or other Confidential Information will be construed as an obligation upon 
Licensor to furnish any person, including End User, any assistance of any kind whatsoever, or 
any information other than the Software, or to revise, supplement, or elaborate upon the 
Software.
   
   c. THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION FURNISHED 
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LICENSED "AS IS" WITH ALL FAULTS, LATENT AND 
PATENT AND WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY TYPE.  LICENSOR MAKES NO 
REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED.  BY WAY OF 
EXAMPLE, BUT NOT OF LIMITATION, LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OF 
MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT THE USE OF 
THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION OR OTHER INFORMATION FURNISHED UNDER 
THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY RIGHT OF ANY THIRD PARTY AND IT SHALL BE THE SOLE RESPONSIBILITY 
OF END USER TO MAKE SUCH DETERMINATION AS IS NECESSARY WITH RESPECT TO 
THE ACQUISITION OF LICENSES UNDER PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. 

    Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties or limitations on how long an 
implied warranty lasts, so the above limitations may not apply to End User.  This warranty gives 
End User specific legal rights and End User may also have other rights which vary from one 
jurisdiction to another.

	d. In the event Licensor and End User enter into a support or maintenance agreement 
applicable to the Software, the terms and conditions of such agreement shall amend and 
supercede the corresponding terms of this LICENSE, but only with respect to the provision of 
assistance by Licensor to End User in connection with the Software. 


7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY 
   
    a. LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE HELD TO ANY LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY 
CLAIM BY END USER OR ANY OTHER THIRD PARTY ON ACCOUNT OF, OR ARISING 
FROM, THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE SOFTWARE, DOCUMENTATION OR 
OTHER INFORMATION FURNISHED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT.
   
    b. Except for End User's breach of Section 4 or violation of the license provisions in this 
LICENSE, neither Licensor nor End User shall be liable for incidental, indirect, special, 
exemplary, or consequential loss or damages of any nature, or for lost profits, savings or 
revenues of any kind, however caused under this LICENSE, whether or not the applicable Party 
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  This provision will survive failure of an 
exclusive remedy.
   
   c. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES ABOVE IS NOT VALID, 
END USER AGREES THAT IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR'S AND ITS AFFILIATES' TOTAL 
LIABILITY UNDER OR RELATED TO THIS LICENSE (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ITS 
LIABILITY UNDER SECTION 10) EXCEED FIVE THOUSAND U.S. DOLLARS (US $5,000).
   
   d. THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE LIMITATIONS OF THIS SECTION ARE ESSENTIAL 
AND THAT END USER WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO USE THE SOFTWARE ABSENT 
THE TERMS OF THIS SECTION.  THIS SECTION WILL SURVIVE AND APPLY EVEN IF ANY 
REMEDY SPECIFIED IN THIS LICENSE MAY BE FOUND TO HAVE FAILED OF ITS 
ESSENTIAL PURPOSE.  


8. FEEDBACK

    In return for this license, if End User provides Licensor or any of its affiliates with any reports on 
bugs or errors in the Software, or reports on the operation of the Software, or suggested 
modifications (collectively, "Feedback") during the term of this LICENSE, Licensor and its 
affiliates shall have the right to use such Feedback for any purpose without payment or 
accounting to End User. End User agrees that under no circumstances will any Feedback 
provided by End User contain any confidential information of End User or of any other third 
party.


9. EXPORT 

    The Parties acknowledge that Software, Documentation, and Confidential Information may be 
subject to the export laws and regulations of the United States, the European Union and/or 
other countries (cumulatively, "Export Laws").  End User shall not use, distribute, export, re-
export, transfer, or transmit the Software, Documentation and Confidential Information (even if 
incorporated into other items) in violation of the Export Laws.  If requested by Licensor, End 
User shall sign written assurances and other export-related documents as may be required for 
Licensor to comply with the Export Laws.


10. PRIVACY  

    Nothing herein will be deemed to grant any right to use the Software, Documentation, or 
Confidential Information in any manner that violates any law or regulation relating to privacy of 
information.  End User shall indemnify and hold harmless Licensor, its affiliates and their 
respective authorized resellers and distributors against all liability for claims of any party relating 
to the use of the Software or Documentation in violation of any privacy-related law or regulation.


11. US GOVERNMENT USE

    The Software is commercial computer software.  If the user or End User of the Software is an 
agency, department, or other entity of the United States Government, the use, duplication, 
reproduction, release, modification, disclosure, or transfer of the Software, or any related 
documentation of any kind, including technical data and manuals, is restricted by a license 
agreement or by the terms of this LICENSE in accordance with Federal Acquisition Regulation 
12.212 for civilian purposes and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement 227.7202 
for military purposes. The Software was developed fully at private expense. All other use is 
prohibited.


12. GENERAL

    a. Except as specifically provided for herein, the waiver from time to time by a Party of any 
of their rights or their failure to exercise any remedy will not operate or be construed as a 
continuing waiver of the same or of any other of such Party's rights or remedies provided in this 
LICENSE.
   
    b. If any term, covenant or condition of this LICENSE or the application thereof to any Party 
or circumstances is, to any extent, held to be invalid or unenforceable, then the remainder of 
this LICENSE, or the application of such term, covenant or condition to parties or circumstances 
other than those as to which it is held invalid or unenforceable, will not be affected thereby and 
each term, covenant or condition of this LICENSE will be valid and be enforced to the fullest 
extent permitted by law.
   
    c. Licensor shall not be liable for any loss, damage, delay, or failure of performance 
resulting directly or indirectly from any cause which is beyond its reasonable control, including, 
but not limited to, acts of God, extraordinary traffic conditions, riots, civil disturbances, wars, 
states of belligerency or acts of the public enemy, strikes, work stoppages, or the laws, 
regulations, acts, or failure to act of any governmental authority.  
   
    d. This LICENSE takes precedence over any conflicting terms or legends which may 
appear in or on the Software, Documentation, or Confidential Information.
   
    e. Section headings contained in this LICENSE are inserted for convenience of reference 
only, will not be deemed to be a part of this LICENSE for any purpose, and will not in any way 
define or affect the meaning, construction or scope of any of the provisions hereof.
   
    f. All notices to Licensor, and all copies of bug fixes, modifications and other derivative 
works of the Software, shall be provided to Licensor in writing by contacting your Nokia 
    representative.

    Changes to the foregoing email address may be made by Licensor upon reasonable notice to 
End User. 

    g. The laws of the State of New York of the United States of America (without giving effect 
to conflicts of law principles) govern all matters arising out of or relating to this LICENSE, 
including, without limitation, its construction, interpretation, performance, and enforcement, 
except if End User is using the Software or Documentation outside of North America or South 
America, in which case the laws of France govern all matters arising out of or relating to this 
LICENSE.
   
    h. The application of the United Nations Convention of Contracts for the International Sale 
of Goods is expressly excluded from this LICENSE.
   
    i. All disputes between the parties will be finally settled in accordance with the Rules of 
Conciliation and Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce by three (3) arbitrators 
designated in conformity with the Rules. In cases where the laws of State of New York of the 
United States of America apply, the arbitration must take place in New York, New York.  In 
cases where the laws of France apply, the arbitration must take place in Geneva, Switzerland.  
   
    j. The Parties hereto have entered into this LICENSE in contemplation of personal 
performance, each by the other, and intend that the licenses and rights granted hereunder to a 
Party not be extended to entities other than such Party's affiliates without the other Party's 
express written consent. An "affiliate" means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under 
common control with a Party. Any purported assignment in violation of this LICENSE is void. 
Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, all of Licensor's rights, title, obligations, and interest in 
this LICENSE and any licenses and rights granted to it hereunder may be assigned to (i) any 
affiliate of Licensor; or (ii) any direct or indirect successor to all or any portion of the business of 
Licensor or its affiliates, which successor will thereafter be deemed substituted for Licensor as 
the Party hereto, effective upon such assignment.


13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT 

    This LICENSE sets forth the entire agreement and understanding between the Parties as to the 
subject matter hereof and merges all prior discussions between them.  Neither of the Parties 
shall be bound by any warranties, understandings or representations with respect to such 
subject matter other than as expressly provided herein, in prior written agreements, or in a 
writing signed with or subsequent to the execution hereof by an authorized representative of the 
Party to be bound thereby.
